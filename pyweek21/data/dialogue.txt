Alpha Blah blah blah I say.
Beta Har de har.


MEETA:
Mel: Holy cow! What was that?!
Mel: Can anybody hear me? Oh, this looks bad.
Mel: I'd better see if there's anyone else out there....

MEETB:
Scamp: Hey over here!
Scamp: Scamp here. Glad to see someone else made it.
Mel: I'm Mel. Are you all right?
Scamp: Yeah but I'm going to need a long nap in a warm hole after this is over.
Mel: Have you seen anybody else? Or heard anything?
Scamp: You know, I thought I heard a signal, but it faded. We should just keep looking.

CHAT1:
Scamp: So what happened here? Do you know?
Mel: No I've never seen anything like it. This whole area turned to a wasteland, just like that.
Scamp: Someone's going to pay for what they've done here.
 
MEETC:
Ignatius: Ah, looks like I'm the not the only one who didn't die. How satisfactory.
Ignatius: Greetings. My name is Ignatius.
Mel: Scamp! Another survivor! What would you say to teaming up, Ignatius? We can cover more ground and keep looking for others.
Scamp: I recommend we stay in radio contact if we get separated.
Ignatius: Yes, that seems like a reasonable course of action.

CHAT2:
Ignatius: What could have happened here? A meteorite? A volcano? Maybe a meteorite volcano?
Ignatius: Killer worms?
Scamp: This is no natural disaster. Someone is to blame.
Mel: You don't suppose it could be the Seeker superweapon?
Scamp: No way! Those are just rumors! Anyway, the Seekers couldn't have done this. Must have been someone else...
Ignatius: I wouldn't rule anything out at this point!  Just think: a volcano made of killer worms!

X1:
Mel: Wow. What is that?
Ignatius: I don't know, but it looks scary.
Scamp: I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it before.
Mel: There are symbols there. I recognize them from somewhere.
Mel: That's it! They were in an encoded message put out by the Seekers last year.
Ignatius: Hey, that seems like something you would know, Scamp. You are a Seeker, after all.
Scamp: What?! How... how did you know that?
Ignatius: Just a suspicion. Until you gave yourself away just now.
Scamp: Very clever. Yes, this looks like something the Seekers made, but I did not have anything to do with it.

MEETD:
Ruby: Ahhhh!
Ignatius: We mean you no harm.
Ruby: Ahhhh!
Ignatius: If you are friendly, please join us.
Ruby: Ahhh!... wait, you mean you're not going to kill me and steal my ship?
Ruby: What a relief!  I was so certain that if anyone was still alive, they would be bloodthirsty pirates.
Ruby: I mean, pirates are okay, as long as they aren't bloodthirsty!
Ruby: And yes, I'm very friendly to nice pirates. My name is Ruby, and I'd love to join you, just please don't kill me!
Mel: We're not pirates!

MEETE:
Hallan: Hello! My name is Hallan. Can you hear me?
Mel: Yes! We're--
Hallan: What a relief! More survivors! Look, I don't want to alarm you, but something very uncool has happened here. Got room for one more?
Mel: Uh... of course, Hallan. I'm sure we could use your help.

MEETF:
Pax: Well well well, what took you so long?
Mel: You knew we were coming?
Pax: No, but I knew someone would look for me eventually. I'm very resourceful, you know.
Scamp: So you know who was behind the attack?
Pax: Well, no. But trust me, you want me around.
Scamp: Oh.

CHATD:
Ruby: You know what I don't see?
Ignatius: What?
Ruby: Dead people. Why aren't there any bodies anywhere?
Ruby: Maybe they were vaporized! Or eaten.... Is that a weird thing to say?

CHATE:
Hallan: This place is such a bummer.
Hallan: My favorite sushi restaurant is right around here. I don't even see it anymore.
Hallan: What happened?

CHATF:
Mel: So much desolation. So many lives lost....  
Pax: What do you have to say for yourself, Scamp?
Scamp: I'm telling you, the Seekers were not behind this!
Pax: Sorry I don't trust the word of a member of an underground movement bent on destroying the world!
Scamp: We're about progress, not destruction.
Pax: But if the future isn't coming fast enough for you, you decide to make it happen, no matter what that takes?
Mel: Come on now! We can't turn against each other now!
