Alpha Blah blah blah I say.
Beta Har de har.

MEETA:
Mel: Holy cow! What was that?!
Mel: Can anybody hear me? Oh, this looks bad.
Mel: I'd better see if there's anyone else out there....

MEETB:
Scamp: Hey over here!
Scamp: Scamp here. Glad to see someone else made it.
Mel: I'm Mel. Are you all right?
Scamp: Yeah but I'm going to need a long nap in a warm hole after this is over.
Mel: Have you seen anybody else? Or heard anything?
Scamp: You know, I thought I heard a signal, but it faded. We should keep looking.

MEETC:
Ignatius: Ah, looks like I'm the not the only one who didn't die. How satisfactory. (not shaken up at all)
Ignatius: Greetings. My name is Ignatius.
Mel: Scamp! Another survivor! What would you say to teaming up, Ignatius? We can cover more ground and keep looking for others.
Scamp: I recommend we stay in radio contact if we get separated.
Ignatius: Yes, that seems like a reasonable course of action.
