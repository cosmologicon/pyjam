C0101 Srock1.5 Dr. Zome!  It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm really looking forward to working in your lab.
C0102 Z First day, huh? Let's see if you can keep this cell safe from diseases.
C0103 Ssink What? How do I do that?
C0104 Z Why, don't let them in, of course! Good luck.
C0201 Z You did so well with that first task, I probably won't fire you today.
C0202 S What is this cell anyway? I've never seen anything like it.
C0203 Z A little something I like to call Project X.
C0204 Ssink Okay. Why do you call it that?
C0205 Zrock2 Because I already failed with Projects A through W, of course!
C0206 S That... doesn't explain anything.
C0301 Zbounce2 This cell is one resilient critter. Let's hit it with everything we've got!
C0302 Srock2 Whoa!  Is that safe?
C0303 Z I don't pay you to be safe.
C0304 Srock3 You don't pay me at all!  I'm just an intern!
C0401 Z Wow, you're really getting the hang of Project X.
C0402 S Are you ready to tell me what it is?
C0403 Z Oh, just a cellular defense system I designed.
C0404 Z I never could make it work correctly, but I knew if I could find some sucker to work on it, it would pan out.
C0405 Z And here you are!
C0406 Ssink Gee, thanks.
C0407 Zrock1.5 That's the spirit!
C0501 Z I admit it, you've taken Project X to levels I never could. But how?
C0502 S It's simple. Instead of making the cell wall stronger, I've designed the cell to be more versatile.
C0503 S It has a variety of ways to defend itself.
C0504 Z Amazing. If you keep this up, I may even give you honorable mention on my research paper!
C0601 Z Bad news, Simon. We're about to lose all our funding.
C0602 S Well, I better go see if the coffee shop is hiring.
C0603 Zrock1.5 Not so fast! The lab director is coming by this afternoon.
C0604 Z If you can pull together a working model today, she might keep our lights on for a few more weeks.
C0605 S That's gonna be pretty tough, Doctor Zome.
C0606 Zbounce2 Nonsense!  You just need to accelerate the testing challenges.
C0607 Z And you know, I've got just the microbe to do it.
C0701 S Now that we've got our funding back, I can get back to work. Can you hand me the sample?
C0702 Z Certainly, here it is.... oops!
C0703 S Oops?
C0704 Z I dropped it.
C0705 Sbounce2 On the floor!?
C0706 Z No, on the ceiling. Now scoop it up and get to work!
C0707 Sbounce2 But we haven't cleaned these floors in months! This sample must be contaminated with all sorts of stuff!
C0708 Z Exactly! The perfect test environment!
C0709 Zrock2 Once again I am the source of a great learning experience.
C0710 Z My work here is done.
C0801 Z I think we're almost ready to enter Project X into the Bio-fest Deathmatch next week.
C0802 S The what?
C0803 Z Never mind! Look, I just got a new shipment of exotic disease cultures.
C0804 Z I was going to slip it into Doctor Condry's coffee, but let's use it on the cell.
C0805 Ssink Right.....
C0901 Z All right.  It's time for the Bio-fest Deathmatch.
C0902 S Why do you keep saying it like that?
C0903 Zrock1.5 Okay, let's go!
C0904 Sbounce2 Wait! What is the Bio-fest Deathmatch anyway?
C1001 Zbounce2 We did it!  We won the competition!
C1002 Sbounce2 Yeah!
C1003 S Uh... What did we win?
C1004 Z The award for the world's most resilient turnip!
C1005 S WHAT!?
C1006 Z Yep! With the Project X gene spliced in, turnips will be able to stay on store shelves almost a whole day longer!
C1007 Zrock1.5 We can make hundreds of dollars at next year's farmer's market!
C1008 Sbounce2 Hundreds?
C1009 Z Well, maybe dozens of dollars.
C1010 Sbounce2 Are you KIDDING!?  I've spent WEEKS on this!
C1011 Ssink ... I don't even LIKE turnips.
E0101 S Doctor Zome, these reactions are crazy! I've never seen anything like it!
E0102 Z Ah yes, that's the thrill of research. You never know what you'll see next.
E0103 Zrock1.5 Why I remember when I was a young researcher....
E0201 Z Did I ever tell you about the time I met my true love at MicrobiCon '98?
E0202 S Yes.  Several times.
E0203 Zrock0.5 I was cosplaying as slime mold. She was flesh-eating bacteria.
E0204 Z Our eyes met across the convention hall floor. She smelled faintly of formaldehyde, my favorite....
E0301 S Yeah, yeah. Sounds like a real a storybook romance.
E0302 Z Well what can you expect, when you're ensnared in the... glamorous... passionate world of micro-biology?
E0303 S Tell me about it.
E0401 Zsink Alas it was not to be.
E0402 Zrock1.5 She could never appreciate the beauty of Project X.
E0403 Z Anyway she went and invented some vaccine that saved a billion people or whatever.
E0404 Z I just know if I can perfect Project X, I can win her back!
E0501 S That's some story, Doctor Zome.
E0502 Z Yes, well, I'm going home. Good night.
E0503 S That is the saddest and most boring story I've ever heard.
E0504 S Who would put all their hopes and dreams into one little cell?
E0505 Srock1.5 Anyway, you're *my* widdle celly welly, aren't you? Yes you are! Yes you are!
