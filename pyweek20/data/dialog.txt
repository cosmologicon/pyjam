intro1:
K Beginning approach to the Charybdis anomaly. I've got time for one last systems check.

intro2:
K Navigation looks good. Checking teleporters....

intro3:
K It's important to remember, once I'm inside the horizon, only data can move upward.
K I won't be able to fly any ships upward, only left, right, and down. The only way to get back up will be to teleport.

intro4:
K Here we go.


convo2:
K I'm below the Charybdis horizon. Besnik, you've got to see this place.
B Copy that, Kendry. I'll stay up here if it's all the same to you.
B We've got shipyards orbiting just outside the horizon. We'll keep a steady supply of empty ships coming down for you.
B When you're onboard a Survey ship, you can activate it to pull up a map.
K You know you'll never get these ships back out, right? Are you sure it's okay to send so many in like this?
B Ships are cheap. Finding the data cores is all that matters. Let me tell you, all of us outside are rooting for you. Good luck, you brave idiot.
K What's the matter, Besnik? Never teleported before?
B A few times, when I've had to. But I've never met someone who liked getting converted into data and beamed across space.
