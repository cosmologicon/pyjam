(1) you run the game in debug mode for the current level you want to build. In settings, set "GenerateOpenSCADScripts" to True and edit the path to your binary for openscad.
There is a script in the code that builds a series of openscad scripts (one for each section) and a master shell script for building all. These get output to tools->generated_section_models->scad
this is built when the game starts, and the game can continue as normal

(2) in a new shell, go to tools/generated_section_models/scad and run the shell script "openscad_script.sh"
this script will generate stl model files (one for each section) and place them in tools/generated_section_models/stl

(3) go to tools/generated_section_models, open a python session and run the script "finalisemodels.py": this will grab each stl, convert it to obj and add in materials/texturing.
(once the script is finished)
You now have the final files you need in the tools/generated_section_models/obj folder. you can copy this folder into models, and rename is to the name of the level this data corresponds to (i.e. game)
So the final thing should be that you have a folder in models/<level_name> and in it a bunch of obj files, one for each section in the level
