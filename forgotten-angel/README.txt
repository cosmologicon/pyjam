--------------------

Use the mouse.

You can probably figure out the mechanics from the instructions in the game. If you get stuck,
please see HINTS.txt.


Options
-------

I ran out of time for command-line options. You can tweak the following:

The screen resolution (1138x640) is specified on line 14 of src/settings.py
You should be able to change it to anything in a 16:9 aspect ratio (854x480, etc.)

To reset your saved game, delete the file savegame.pkl.
